When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when i'm not working on my computer, when i want to share my code  

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    cause there are some changes that someone made , and i'm not always ready for my files to be change without my knowledge and i didn't save that file yet in this case it'll override the file that i'm working on, or maybe we both create some changes on the same file and commit it. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork- when u copy someone else repository can only do it on GitHub, will use it when i want to copy and work on another repository and i don't have permission or don't want to affect his repository.
	clone - when u copy a repository local to remote, local to local 
	branch - create another path / folder while maintaining the main master branch , to work on another feature, fix etc. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    it's good if u want to check if someone else worked on the same file as u do, so u can compare before u commit, also to check what new changes has occurred.  
	

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    i would use emails and skype, and we if have a working software like producteev, assembla , newDLS i'll use that

master?  What benefits does each approach have?
